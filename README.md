# Store&Inventory_Management System
DBMS project for managing store inventory, sales, customers, and suppliers efficiently
 Detailed Requirements of the Project
1.1 Main Idea of the Project
Running a store can be extremely labor intensive and time consuming. From maintaining inventory
records to handling daily operations, saving copious amounts of customer and product data can be
challenging and difficult to maintain. But all these can be easily solved with an all-in-one application
that can handle all of these problems and automate them decreasing the required labor cost and time
spent on these tasks. The main goal of this project is to develop such application that can handle
all these tasks efficiently and is easy to use and at the same time has a strong infrastructure where
storing, retrieval and modification of data is efficient, fast and reliable.
